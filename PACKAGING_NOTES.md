# Packaging Configuration Changes

## OCR Functionality Removal

For distribution packaging, OCR functionality has been **removed** to simplify the build process and reduce dependencies. This change affects:

### Removed Dependencies
- `opencv-python` (cv2)
- `pytesseract` 
- `tesseract`
- `Pillow` (PIL)
- `numpy`
- `pyautogui`

### Benefits of Removal
✅ **Smaller Package Size**: ~200MB+ reduction in final package size  
✅ **Faster Build Times**: No need to compile native libraries  
✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Eliminates Tesseract OCR installation requirements  
✅ **Simplified Deployment**: No external OCR binaries needed  
✅ **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer potential build failures  

### Files Modified
- `multi_ai_desktop.spec` - PyInstaller configuration
- `setup_macos.py` - py2app configuration  
- `requirements_packaging.txt` - Simplified dependencies
- `build_windows.ps1` - Updated to use packaging requirements
- `build_macos.sh` - Updated to use packaging requirements
- `validate_build.py` - Updated validation checks

### Application Impact
- **Text input mirroring**: ✅ Still works (JavaScript-based)
- **Multi-AI chat**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Web interface embedding**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Screenshot OCR**: ❌ Removed in packaged builds
- **Image text extraction**: ❌ Removed in packaged builds

### For Development
If you need OCR functionality during development:
```bash
# Use the full requirements for development
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Use simplified requirements for packaging
pip install -r requirements_packaging.txt
```

### Packaging Commands
```bash
# Windows
.\build_windows.ps1

# macOS  
./build_macos.sh --clean
```

The packaged applications will focus on the core multi-AI functionality while maintaining a clean, lightweight distribution.
